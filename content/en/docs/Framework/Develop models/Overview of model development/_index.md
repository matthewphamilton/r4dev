  This section describes the distinctive features of developing computational models with the ready4 framework.
---

ready4 provides a framework for developing computational models that are modular. A modular model is one that can be constructed from multiple self-contained components, each of which is independently re-usable in other modelling projects. Each ready4 module describes a data structure and the set of algorithms that can be applied to it. Modules can be combined to model more extensive systems.
