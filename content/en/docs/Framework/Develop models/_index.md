  This section outlines how computational models of youth mental health systems are implemented under the ready4 framework.

ready4 provides a framework for developing computational models that are modular. A modular model is one that can be constructed from multiple self-contained components, each of which is independently re-usable in other modelling projects. Each ready4 module describes a data structure and the set of algorithms that can be applied to it. Modules can be combined to model more extensive systems. 

This section describes a number of developer tools to help develop modular computational models. This section will be of principal interest to developers (i.e. people who spend large amounts of their time writing code).
