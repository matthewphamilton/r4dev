  This section outlines how computational models of youth mental health systems are implemented under the ready4 framework.
---

ready4 provides a framework for developing computational models that are modular. A modular model is one that can be constructed from multiple self-contained components, each of which is independently re-usable in other modelling projects. Each ready4 module describes a data structure and the set of algorithms that can be applied to it. Modules can be combined to model more extensive systems. 

Currently documentation for teams who wish to use the ready4 framework to develop models is underdeveloped. This section provides some introductory content, but detailed step by step guides have yet to be developed.
