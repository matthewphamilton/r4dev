  How ready4 aims to improve the availability, quality and usefulness of computational models in youth mental health.
---

## What is ready4?
ready4 is a modular, open source computational model of the systems that shape young people's mental health, being developed with a novel modelling framework. 

## What do you mean by framework?
By [framework](../getting-started/concepts/framework) we mean a set of good practice guidelines for computational models in youth mental health and the [software](../getting-started/software)  (in our case, written in R) to help implement models that adhere to those guidelines.

## What is a computational model?
When we use the term [computational model](../getting-started/concepts/model), we are typically referring to a simplified representation of a system of interest that is implemented in computer code.

## Why is it modular?
The *modular* approach we are takeing to computational model development means multiple self-contained computational modelling projects can be both combined (to model more extensive systems) and reused (in other models).

## Why do I want it?
ready4 is free for you to inspect (to find tools you trust and find useful), apply (to generate novel insights into decision problems of interest to you) and to derive your own derivative works from (that both leverage and enhances the work of other modellers).

## Why is it called ready4?
ready4 is shorthand for "ready for what's next". The name refers to both how better mental health can improve the lives of young people and to how better computational models can improve the preparedness of decision makers and system planners.

## Where should I go next?
We'd recommend reading the documentation in the order in which sections appear in the table of contents (so go next to [Examples](/docs/examples/), then to [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) and so on). The relevance to you of some parts of the documentation will depend on whether you see yourself using ready4 as a [coder](../getting-started/users/coder), a [modeller](../getting-started/users/modeller) or a [planner](../getting-started/users/planner). For this reason some sections of the documentation are labelled as being written for a specific type of reader.
