  How ready4 aims to improve policy and system planning in youth mental health.
---

## What is ready4?
ready4 is a modular, open source computational model of the systems that shape young people's mental health that is being developed with a novel modelling framework. 

## What is a computational model?
When we use the term [computational model](../getting-started/concepts/model), we are typically referring to a simplified representation of a system of interest that is implemented in computer code.

## Why is it modular?
The [modular](../framework/modularity/) approach we are taking to computational model development means multiple self-contained computational model components can be both [combined (to model more extensive systems) and reused (in other models)](../model).

## What do you mean by framework?
Our [framework](../getting-started/concepts/framework) comprises a set of common standards and the [software](../getting-started/software) (in our case, written in R) to help implement a computational model that adheres to those guidelines.

## Why is that useful?
As a modular and open-source project, we hope that ready4 will facilitate more transparent, collaborative, extensive and flexible approaches to [implementing analyses](../analyses) and [sharing data](../datasets) that [generate valuable insights for youth mental health policymakers and system planners](../examples).

## Can I use it?
ready4 is designed to be used by [coders](../getting-started/users/coder), [modellers](../getting-started/users/modeller) and [planners](../getting-started/users/planner). ready4 is free for you to inspect (to find tools you trust and find useful), apply (to generate novel insights into decision problems of interest to you) and to derive your own derivative works from (that both leverage and enhances the work of other modellers), [under liberal licensing arrangements](../getting-started/software/terms/).

## Can I help?
We'd love your help in progressing our [priorty project goals](../contribution-guidelines/priorities/)! You can [contribute code improvements](../contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/code/), [enhance our documentation and community support](../contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/community/), [extend the topics to which ready4 can be applied](../contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/extensions/) and [help fund our development](../contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/funding/).

## Why is it called ready4?
ready4 is shorthand for "ready for what's next". The name refers to both how better mental health can improve the lives of young people and to how better computational models can improve the preparedness of decision makers and system planners.

## Where should I go next?
We'd recommend reading the documentation in the order in which sections appear in the table of contents (so go next to [Examples](/docs/examples/), then to [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) and so on). Some sections of the documentation are labelled as being written for a specific type of reader.
