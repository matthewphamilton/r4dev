  How ready4 aims to improve policy and system planning in youth mental health.
---

## What is ready4?
ready4 is a modular computational model of the systems that shape young people's mental health that is being developed as an open source project. 

## What is a computational model?
When we use the term [computational model](../getting-started/concepts/model), we are typically referring to a simplified representation of a system of interest that is implemented in computer code.

## What makes it modular?
The approach we are taking to computational model development means that individual model components ([modules](../framework/modularity/)) can be independently [reused (in other models) and flexibly combined (to model more extensive systems)](../model) as if they were Lego bricks.

## How as that achieved?
To facilitate interoperability between modules developed by multiple modelling teams, we have defined a [framework](../getting-started/concepts/framework) for model development that comprises a set of explicit standards and the [software](../getting-started/software) (in our case, written in R) to implement modules that adhere to those standards.

## Why is that useful?
Modelling youth mental health systems is a complex task - that means its easy to make mistakes and is more likely to be done well if approached collaboratively, transparently and given sufficient time. We hope that ready4 will support these approaches and in so doing help to [share data](../datasets), improve the reproducibility of [modelling analyses](../analyses) and [generate valuable insights for youth mental health policymakers and system planners](../examples).

## Can I use it?
ready4 is designed to be used by [coders](../getting-started/users/coder), [modellers](../getting-started/users/modeller) and [planners](../getting-started/users/planner). ready4 is free for you to inspect (to find tools you trust and find useful), apply (to generate novel insights into decision problems of interest to you) and to derive your own derivative works from (that both leverage and enhances the work of other modellers), [under liberal licensing arrangements](../getting-started/software/terms/).

## Can I help?
We'd love your help in progressing our [priorty project goals](../contribution-guidelines/priorities/)! You can [contribute code improvements](../contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/code/), [enhance our documentation and community support](../contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/community/), [extend the topics to which ready4 can be applied](../contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/extensions/) and [help fund our development](../contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/funding/).

## Why is it called ready4?
ready4 is shorthand for "ready for what's next". The name refers to both how better mental health can improve the lives of young people and to how better computational models can improve the preparedness of decision makers and system planners.

## Where should I go next?
We'd recommend reading the documentation in the order in which sections appear in the table of contents (so go next to [Examples](/docs/examples/), then to [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) and so on). Some sections of the documentation are labelled as being written for a specific type of reader.
