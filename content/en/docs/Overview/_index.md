  How ready4 aims to improve the availability, quality and usefulness of decision models in youth mental health.

## What is ready4?

ready4 is a framework for developing open source computational models of the people, places, platforms and programs that shape young people's mental health. 

## What is a computational model?
 When we use the term computational model, we are typically referring to the part of a health economic model that is implemented in computer code.

## What do you mean by framework?

By framework we mean a set of good practice guidelines for open source health economic computational models and the software (in our case, written in R) to help implement models that adhere to those guidelines.

## Why is that useful?

Using the ready4 framework supports *modular* approaches to computational model development. That means multiple self-contained computational modelling projects can be both combined (to model more extensive systems) and reused (in other models).

## Why do I want it?

The ready4 framework and the modelling projects we are developing with it are free for you to inspect (to find tools you trust and find useful), apply (to generate novel insights into decision problems of interest to you) and to derive your own derivative works from (that both leverage and enhances the work of other modellers).

## Why is it called ready4?

We originally developed ready4 to help us implement an open source computational model of youth mental health called readyforwhatsnext. That remains the overarching purpose of our open source health economic modelling work at Orygen, but we have made the ready4 framework publicly available so that others can use it for their own projects.

## Where should I go next?

We'd recommend reading the documentation in the order in which sections appear in the table of contents (so go next to [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/), then to [Examples](/docs/examples/) and so on). The relevance to you of some parts of the documentation will depend on whether you see yourself primarily as a data scientist (you write code for a living), a modeller (you build model based decision aids) or an analyst (you work in policy development or service planning). For this reason some sections of the documentation are labelled as being written for a specific type of reader.
