---

## Prerequisites

A pre-requisite for data scientists and modellers is to have an up to date version of R installed on your machine. In most (but not all) of the anticipated ways that analysts will use ready4 tools, there is no not need to have R installed.

## Installation

Both developers and modellers need to install the ready4 package.

## Setup

Is there any initial setup users need to do after installation to try your project?

## Try it out!

Can your users test their installation, for example by running a command or deploying a Hello World example?
