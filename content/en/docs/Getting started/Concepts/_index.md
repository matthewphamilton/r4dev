  A number of concepts that are helpful to understand when using ready4.

## Model
In the context that we use it, a model is a simplified representation of a system of interest. 

A model should ideally have three inter-related representations:

 - a *conceptual model* (the model's underlying theory and beliefs, that can be described in words and pictures);
 
 - a *mathematical model* (the model's mathematical formalisation, that can be written as equations); and 
 
 - a *computational model* (the model's implementation, written in computer code). 
 
In the context that we use it, the term model encompasses all three of these components. We also mean that a model is:

- abstract and general (i.e. largely free of data that is assumption- or context- specific) and
- a tool, not an analysis (i.e. although a model can be used to help undertake an analysis, it is not the analysis itself).

If a model is developed primarily to inform a decision or set of decisions (e.g. relating to youth mental health policy and system design) it can be called a *decision model*. 

## Model Data
As we use the term, "model data" refers to information, principally relating to model parameter values, that can be added to a model to tailor it to a specific decision context (e.g a particular population / jurisdiction / service / intervention) and set of underpinning beliefs (e.g. preferred evidence sources).

## Model Application
As we use it, this term encompasses:

- the reproduction or replication programs that configure models and apply them to specified data; and
- the outputs generated by implementing a model reproduction or replication program, including but not limited to analysis reports.


## Modelling Project
In the context we use it, a modelling project will typically involve all three steps of:

- Developing a model;

- Adding context-specific data to that model; and

- Applying the model to undertake analyses relevant to (a) decision problem(s).


## Modelling Guidelines
ready4 has been developed to implement a set of good practice guidelines for open source health economic models. We are describing these guidelines, their rationale and how ready4 implements them, in a manuscript being prepared for publication. When it is publicly available we will provide a link in an updated version of this page.
