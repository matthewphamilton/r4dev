  A number of concepts that are helpful to understand when using ready4.

## Modelling Project
In the context we use it, a modelling project involves the three steps of:

- Developing a *model*;

- Adding context-specific *data* to that model; and

- *Application* of the model to the supplied data to generate insight.

## Model
By "model", we mean a simplified representation of a system of interest. 

Ideally, a model should have three inter-related representations:

 - a *conceptual model* (the model's underlying theory and beliefs, that can be described in words and pictures);
 
 - a *mathematical model* (the model's mathematical formalisation, that can be written as equations); and 
 
 - a *computational model* (the model's implementation, written in computer code). 
 
As we use it, the term model encompasses all three of these components, though ready4 is specifically concerned with providing tools to enhance computational models.

We also mean that a model is:

- abstract and general (i.e. largely free of data that is assumption- or context- specific) and
- a tool, not an analysis (i.e. although a model can be used to help undertake an analysis, it is not the analysis itself).

If a model is developed primarily to inform a decision or set of decisions (e.g. relating to youth mental health policy and system design) it can be called a *decision model*. 

## Model Data
As we use the term, "model data" refers to information, principally relating to model parameter values, that can be added to a model to tailor it to a specific decision context (e.g a particular population / jurisdiction / service / intervention) and set of underpinning beliefs (e.g. preferred evidence sources).

## Model Application
As we use it, this term refers to use of a model to model to perform analyses with a specified set of input data. As ready4 is focused on computational models, when we talk about model application we are principally concerned with:

- the reproduction or replication programs that configure models and apply them to specified data; and
- the outputs generated by implementing a model reproduction or replication program, including but not limited to analysis reports.


## Modelling Guidelines
ready4 has been developed to implement a set of good practice guidelines for open source health economic models. We are describing these guidelines, their rationale and how ready4 implements them, in a manuscript being prepared for publication. When it is publicly available we will provide a link in an updated version of this page.
