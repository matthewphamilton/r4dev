  The open access repositories supported by ready4.

## Code repositories
ready4 is designed to work with three types of code repository:

- [Github](https://github.com) - for development / pre-release code; 
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) - for archived code releases; and
- [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) - for production releases of R packages.

The most up to date development version source code for all ready4 software is available in the [ready4-dev GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ready4-dev). 

Releases of ready4 software are uniquely identified (with a DOI) and archived in the [ready4 Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/ready4).

## Data repositories
For all other types of data, ready4 is designed to work with [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org) installations (but has only been tested on the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu)). Datasets that we have created for use with ready4 are available in the [ready4 section of the Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ready4).
