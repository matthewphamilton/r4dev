  The open access repositories supported by ready4

## Code repositories
ready4 is designed to work with three types of code repository:

- GitHub; and
- Zenodo.

The most up to date development version source code for all ready4 software is available in the [ready4-dev GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ready4-dev). 

Releases of ready4 software are uniquely identified (with a DOI) and archived in the [ready4 Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/ready4).

## Data repositories
For all other types of data, ready4 is designed to work with Dataverse installations (but has only been tested on the Harvard Dataverse). Datasets that we have created for use with ready4 are available in the [ready4 section of the Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ready4).
