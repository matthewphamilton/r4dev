  How you use ready4 will depend on the type of work you do.

## Data scientists
Data scientists can use ready4 to help write the code that implements computational models of youth mental health. If you are a data scientist, you write code for a living, will almost certainly have a GitHub account and have probably written or plan to write code libraries. The main benefit to you of using ready4 is a combination of enhanced impact (by supporting modular approaches to computational models, ready4 will help your code to be more readily usable by others) and efficiency (ready4 supports partial automation of code development and quality-assurance workflows). You may also wish to contribute to the development of the ready4 project by either testing and improving our existing software (including its documentation) or write new libraries of ready4 modules.

## Modellers
Modellers can use ready4 to implement open source health economic models of youth mental health. If you are a modeller, you are responsible for the overall implementation of a modelling project from initial conceptualisation through to analysis and reporting. You are likely to be an economist, epidemiologist or statistician and are probably reasonably comfortable with writing analysis scripts in statistical software (potentially including R), without necessarily being a coding wizard. In using ready4 you will typically select and combine computational model modules already written by others or collaborate with data scientists to develop new modules. The main benefit you will get from ready4 is implementing reproducible workflows that extract novel insights from your own data and which share results in formats that facilitate re-use by others.

## Planners
Planners can use youth mental health decision-aids developed with ready4 to generate insights relevant to their contexts. If you are an planner, you are likely to contribute to policy development or service planning, you value the role of modelling to inform your work, but are more likely to use models developed by others than to build your own. The main benefit planners will get from ready4 is through availing of user-interfaces that make it easier for less technically minded users to configure and run models built with ready4 computational models or by reviewing reports of analyses undertaken with the aid of ready4 tools.
