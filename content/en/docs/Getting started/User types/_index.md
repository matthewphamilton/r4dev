  How you use ready4 will depend on the type of work you do.

We have written this documentation with three types of user in mind: Data scientists, Modellers and Planners. All are assumed to work on projects related to the mental health and wellbeing of young people.

## Data scientists
Data scientists can use ready4 to help them write the code that implements computational models of youth mental health. If you are a data scientist, you write code for a living, will almost certainly have a GitHub account and have probably written or plan to write code libraries. The main benefit to you of using ready4 is a combination of enhanced impact (by supporting modular approaches to computational models, ready4 will help your code to be more readily usable by others) and efficiency (ready4 supports partial automation of code development and quality-assurance workflows). You may also wish to contribute to the development of the ready4 project by either testing and improving our existing software (including its documentation) or write new libraries of ready4 modules.

## Modellers
Modellers can use ready4 to implement open source health economic models of youth mental health. If you are a modeller, you are responsible for the overall implementation of a modelling project from initial conceptualisation through to analysis and reporting. You are likely to be an economist, epidemiologist or statistician and are probably reasonably comfortable with writing analysis scripts in statistical software (potentially including R), without necessarily being a coding wizard. The main benefit you will get from ready4 is through using it to apply computational model modules written by others to your own data to produce novel insights using reproducible workflows.

## Planners
Planners can use youth mental health decision-aids developed with ready4 to generate insights relevant to their contexts. If you are an planner, you are likely to contribute to policy development or service planning, you value the role of modelling to inform your work, but are more likely to use models developed by others than to build your own. The main benefit planners will get from ready4 is through availing of user-interfaces that make it easier for less technically minded users to configure and run models built with ready4 computational models or by reviewing reports of analyses undertaken with the aid of ready4 tools.
