  Multiple copies of our software's source code exist, each with a different status and purpose.

## Development code
Impermanent (as these repositories can be moved, renamed or deleted at any time) copies of all versions of our software items over their entire development history (including the most up to date development version) are stored in the [ready4 GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ready4-dev). Accessing the latest development version of the code is particularly useful to people who wish to contribute bug fixes or new features to the code. Public access to development versions of code also allow individuals to install, test and preview code in advance of production versions being released.

## Archived code
Permanent, uniquely identified (with DOI) archive copies of software items that we have issued as “releases” are stored within the [ready4 Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/ready4). Archived versions of the software are useful as they are snapshots of code at key milestones in its development (e.g. at the time an analysis was undertaken). Metadata on software we have archived on Zenodo are typically indexed by and retrievable from [OpenAire](https://explore.openaire.eu/). 

## Production code
Production releases are those intended for end-users and which we feel have undergone sufficient quality assurance checks and been adequately documented for this purpose. We have yet to make production releases of our software, but we plan to do this in 2023. Our production releases of code libraries will be submitted to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Unless and until a software item is submitted to a production code repository like CRAN, the recommended platform from which to install our software is that software's GitHub repository.
