## Development code
Development code is a complete record of all versions of a ready4 software project's code over its entire development history (including the most up to date pre-release development version). All ready4 development code is stored in the [ready4 GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ready4-dev). Accessing the latest development version of the code is particularly useful to people who wish to contribute bug fixes or new features to the code. Public access to development versions of code also allow individuals to install, test and preview code in advance of production versions being released. Other advantages of development code is providing transparency as to who contributed what to a software project and when these contributions were made. Limitations of development code include the likelihood that some or all of this code may be inadequately documented or tested. It is generally considered good practice to try to avoid citing development version code stored in GitHub repositories as these repositories are impermanent (they can be moved, renamed or deleted at any time).

## Archived code
Archive copies of software items that we have issued as “releases” are stored as permanent, uniquely identified (with DOI) and citable records within the [ready4 Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/ready4). Archived versions of ready4 software are useful as they are snapshots of code at key milestones in its development (e.g. at the time an analysis was undertaken). As these milestones are purposely selected, archived versions are more likely to have undergone some testing and documenting prior to being released than unreleased code. Metadata on the software we have archived on Zenodo are often also indexed by and retrievable from [OpenAire](https://explore.openaire.eu/). 

## Production code
Production releases of our code are intended for end-users and signal that they have undergone a number of quality assurance checks and have some supporting documentation. 
**We have yet to make any production releases of ready4 software**, but plan to do this in 2023. Production releases of ready4 code libraries will be submitted to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Unless and until a software item is submitted to a production code repository like CRAN, the recommended platform from which to install our software is that software's GitHub repository.
