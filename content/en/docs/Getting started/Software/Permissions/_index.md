## Using and extending ready4
To help ensure the models we develop are as transparent as possible and to make their algorithms as useful to others as possible, all ready4 software is free and open-source. You are encouraged to make as widespread use of our software, including the creation of derivative works, as you see fit, so long as it is consistent with each item's license. Our software is typically licensed under [GPL-3](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4/LICENSE.html), a copy-left open-source licensing regime.

## Citing ready4
Each archived version of any software item we have released has its own unique Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Citing a specific version therefore requires the version specific DOI plus text such as “version 0.0.9.3”.  Each software item also has a generic DOI that can be used to refer to all versions of the software. Note that, if clicked on, the generic DOI will resolve to the latest archived version.

To make it easier to cite our software, each software item includes a CITATION.cff file. Inclusion of this file means that the repositories storing our software can generate appropriate citations in the format of most relevance to you. Currently:
 - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) provides a free text field under the heading “Cite as” which enables you to generate a wide range of citation manager and journal specific citation outputs. There is also an “Export” tool that will generate citation metadata in multiple output formats;
 - [OpenAire Explore](https://explore.openaire.eu) has a “Cite this software” button that allows you to generate a citation in multiple journal formats or to download BibTeX or RIS files;
 - [Github](https://github.com) repositories have a “Cite this repository” button that can generate both BibTeX and APA output as well as link to the Citation.cff file.

Additionally, we have included a CITATION file in each of our R [libraries](../../publications/libraries/) so that you can generate a citation from within an R session using the `citation` function (for example: `citation("ready4")`.
