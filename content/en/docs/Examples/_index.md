  See ready4 in action!
---

Some examples of practical applications of computational models developed with the ready4 framework include:

- Assessing the heterogeneity of quality of life amongst a clinical sample of young people (peer-reviewed manuscript and R package). 
- Mapping psychological and functional measures to health utility for young people using primary mental health services (pre-print manuscript, results and replication dataset and R packages for developing and applying models);
- Developing and analysing discrete choice experiments in youth mental health (R package);
- Predicting the future spatial distribution of mental disorder in young people (sample reports dataset and policy briefing).
