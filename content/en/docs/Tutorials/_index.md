How you use ready4 will depend on the type of work you do. For this reason, we have organised the tutorials based on three broad profiles of user type. 

* Tutorials for modellers are aimed at people who build youth mental health models. If you are a modeller, you are likely to be an economist, epidemiologist or statistician and are reasonably comfortable with writing analysis scripts in statistical software like R, without necessarily being a coding wizard. The Tutorials we have written for you are principally about using existing ready4 modules and applying it to your own data to produce bespoke analysis.

* Tutorials for developers are aimed at people who develop software for a living. If you are a developer, you are likely to be a data scientist or programmer, you will almost certainly have a GitHub account and have probably written or plan to write code libraries. The Tutorials we have written for you are principally about how to contribute to the development of the ready4 project by either testing and improving our existing software (including its documentation) or write new libraries of ready4 modules.

* Tutorials for analysts are aimed at people who apply the insights from youth mental health models. If you are an analyst, you are likely to contribute to policy development or service planning, you value the role of modelling to inform your work, but are more likely to use models developed by others than to build your own. We have yet to write tutorials for you but expect to have some available later this year. The Tutorials we will write for you are principally about how to use user-interfaces that make it easier for less technically minded users to configure and run models built with ready4 modules.
