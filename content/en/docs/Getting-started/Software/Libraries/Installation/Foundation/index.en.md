All software in the ready4 suite depends on the [ready4 foundation library](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4/). For this reason, in most cases you do not need to install the framework foundation directly as it will be imported as a dependency in all other ready4 libraries.

However, if you wish to install it separately you can do so directly from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ready4-dev/ready4) (it is currently only available as a development release).

## Try it out!

Before you apply ready4 tools to your own project, you should make sure you can run some or all of the example code included in the [package vignettes](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4/articles/).
