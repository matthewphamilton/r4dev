  Important information to review before installing and using our software
---

ready4 libraries are currently only available as development releases, so you will need to use a tool like [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org) to assist with installing ready4 R packages directly from [our GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ready4-dev). If you do not have devtools on your machine you can install it with the following command.

```r
utils::install.packages("devtools")
```
