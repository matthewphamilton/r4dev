  ready4 applications make it easier for non-technical users to explore and use our tools.
---

ready4 applications are programs that are run interactively via a user-interface. They are designed to be easily used by individuals with non-technical backgrounds (i.e. they do not require any knowledge of computer code). Our applications are typically deployed as Shiny apps an may have deployments via the web (in which case you do not need to install anything) or to your desktop (as part of a ready4 [library](../libraries/)). The main purposes of ready4 applications are:

- to make it easy for non-technical users to configure a computational model and apply it to selected input data; and

- as an accessible means of demonstrating key concepts relating to ready4.

The [application to demonstrate the dependencies of ready4 libraries](../libraries/dependencies/) is an example of the latter use.

We do not have any current releases of ready4 applications for running models. However, an old and [deprecated application for running the Springtides model](../../../model-applications/spatial-modelling/springtides-app/) is available for purely illustrative purposes.
