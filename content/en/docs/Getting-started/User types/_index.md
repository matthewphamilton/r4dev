  How you use ready4 will depend on the type of work you do.

## Data scientists
Data scientists can use ready4 to help write the code that implements computational models of youth mental health. If you are a data scientist, you write code for a living, will almost certainly have a GitHub account and have probably written or plan to write code libraries. We hope that ready4 can be of benefit to your youth mental health modelling projects through a combination of enhanced impact (supporting modular approaches to computational models that facilitate re-use by others) and efficiency (through partial automation of code development and quality-assurance workflows). You may also wish to contribute to the development of the ready4 project by either testing and improving our existing software (including its documentation) or by writing new libraries of ready4 modules.

## Modellers
Modellers can use ready4 to implement open source health economic models of youth mental health. If you are a modeller, you are responsible for the overall implementation of a modelling project from initial conceptualisation through to analysis and reporting. You are likely to be an economist, epidemiologist or statistician and are probably reasonably comfortable with writing analysis scripts in statistical software (potentially including R), without necessarily being a coding wizard. We hope that ready4 can be of benefit to you by helping you to find, use and combine relevant model algorithms and datasets written by others, to implement reproducible workflows in your youth mental health modelling projects, and to share your results in formats that are more readily accessible by others. You could also contribute to the development of the ready4 project by collaborating with data scientists to develop new modules addressing important youth mental health modelling topics. 

## Planners
Planners can use youth mental health decision-aids developed with ready4 to generate insights relevant to their contexts. If you are an planner, you are likely to contribute to policy development or service planning, you value the role of modelling to inform your work, but are more likely to use models developed by others than to build your own. We hope that ready4 can be of benefit to you through providing user-interfaces that make it easier for less technically minded users to configure and run models built with ready4 computational models.
