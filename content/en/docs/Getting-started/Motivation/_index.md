  ready4 aims to facilitate more valid and useful models of youth mental health systems.
---

Improving the mental health and wellbeing of young people is a global public health priority. However, identifying the optimal policy and system design choices to meet this challenge is not straightforward. A valid, contextual and multipurpose model of the most important ways that economic, environmental, healthcare, social and technological systems interact to shape youth mental health would be potentially very helpful for decision makers. 

Developing such a model is a major, resource-intensive and long-term undertaking. Traditional approaches to health economic model development are unlikely to be sufficient to achieve this goal for reasons that include:

- the complexity of the task is likely to be beyond the capacity of any single modelling team, so [collaborative development](/community/) is much more important;
- a barrier to effective collaboration is that different modelling teams working on distinct but potentially related projects adopt heterogeneous approaches to model conceptualisation, licensing, taxonomies and technical implementations - combining multiple projects will require some form of a common [framework](/docs/framework/);
- another barrier to modellers using each other's work is that models of health systems, particularly health economic models, can be hard to generalise unless adopting [code implementation paradigms](/docs/framework/implementation/paradigm/) that facilitate adaptability for alternative decision contexts; 
- project finance is typically provided by a single funder, for projects with defined end-points that focus on producing a relatively small number of pre-specified analyses, meaning [a longer term field building initiative](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/funding/) is required to ensure that [computational modelling projects](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/) from multiple funders can be combined, re-used, kept up to date and extended; and
- errors, common in even relatively simple health economic models, become more likely as model complexity grows and therefore require much stronger validation and verification processes and increased emphasis on implementing [reproducible and replicable modelling analyses](/docs/analyses/).

ready4 aims to implement a youth mental health systems model that address each of these challenges.
