  ready4 aims to facilitate more valid and useful models of youth mental health systems.
---

Improving the mental health and wellbeing of young people is a global public health priority. However, identifying the optimal policy and system design choices to meet this challenge is not straightforward. A valid, contextual and multipurpose model of the most important ways that economic, environmental, healthcare, social and technological systems interact to shape youth mental health would be potentially very helpful for decision makers. 

Developing such a model is a major, resource-intensive and long-term undertaking. Traditional approaches to health economic model development are unlikely to be sufficient to achieve this goal for reasons that include:

- the complexity of the task is likely to be beyond the capacity of any single modelling team, so collaborative development is much more important;
- facilitating collaboration means that independent modelling projects of different modelling teams can be cohesively linked through a common framework and are sufficiently general in representation to be readily adapted for alternative decision contexts; 
- a longer project implementation time horizon makes it more important for useful independently usable model sub-components to released throughout the model development cycle and for model algorithms and data to be regularly updated; and
- errors, common in even relatively simple health economic models, become more likely as model complexity grows and therefore require much stronger validation and verification processes and increased emphasis on reproducibility and replicability of modelling analyses.
