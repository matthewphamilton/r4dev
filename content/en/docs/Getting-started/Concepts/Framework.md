  The ready4 framework is a set of explicit guidelines and the software to ensure they are consistently implemented.

## Guidelines
We have developed a set of guidelines that we believe represent good practice in the development of health economic [computational models](../model). We are describing these guidelines, their rationale and how ready4 implements them, in a manuscript being prepared for publication. When it is publicly available we will provide a link in an updated version of this page.

## Software tools
The [software tools](../../software) to help ensure that the ready4 model adheres to these guidelines is distributed as a collection of [framework code libraries](../../software/libraries/types/framework).
