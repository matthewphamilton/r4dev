  You can apply ready4 to the three main parts of a computational modelling project.
---

In simple terms, a computational modelling project involves:

- Developing and validating a [computational model](../model);

- Adding context-specific *data* to that computational model; and

- Applying the computational model to the supplied data to undertake *analyses*.

### Data
When we refer to data we typically mean digitally stored information, principally relating to model parameter values, that can be added to the ready4 computational model to tailor it to a specific decision context (e.g. a particular population / jurisdiction / service / intervention) and set of underpinning beliefs (e.g. preferred evidence sources).

### Analyses
When we refer to analyses, we typically mean the application of the ready4 computational model to a specified set of input data to generate insight. Our use of the term application can encompass:

- the reproduction or replication programs that configure models and apply them to specified data; and
- the outputs generated by implementing a model reproduction or replication program, including but not limited to analysis reports.
