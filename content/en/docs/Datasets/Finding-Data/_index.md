  Open access datasets developed for use with ready4 modules.
---

A number of datasets are to help tailor the purposely general algorithms and data structures represented by ready4 framework computational models to more specific contexts and decision problems. Currently these datasets reflect contexts relevant to youth mental health in Australia. Datasets that we have created for use with ready4 are available in the [ready4 section of the Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ready4).
