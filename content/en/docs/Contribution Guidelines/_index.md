  How to contribute to the ready4 and readyforwhatsnext projects
---

How you use the ready4 framework will depend on the type of work you do. For this reason, we have organised our contribution guidance based on three broad profiles of user type. 

* Guidance for modellers is aimed at people who build youth mental health models. If you are a modeller, you are likely to be an economist, epidemiologist or statistician and are reasonably comfortable with writing analysis scripts in statistical software like R, without necessarily being a coding wizard. The guidance we have written for you assumes that you are principally interested in using existing ready4 modules and applying them to your own data to produce bespoke analysis.

* Guidance for data scientists is aimed at people who write code for a living. If you are a data scientist, you will almost certainly have a GitHub account and have probably written or plan to write code libraries. The Tutorials we have written for you assumes that you may wish to contribute to the development of the ready4 project by either testing and improving our existing software (including its documentation) or write new libraries of ready4 modules.

* Guidance for planners are aimed at people who apply the insights from youth mental health models. If you are an analyst, you are likely to contribute to policy development or service planning, you value the role of modelling to inform your work, but are more likely to use models developed by others than to build your own. The guidance wehave written for you assumes that you are principally interested in applying user-interfaces that make it easier for less technically minded users to configure and run models built with ready4 modules.
