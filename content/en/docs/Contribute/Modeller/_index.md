  Guidelines outlining how decision modellers in youth mental health can contribute to the development of ready4.
---


First things first - **you do not have to ask us permission or pay us any money to use, extend or derive new works from ready4 modules, data or analysis scripts.** Your only obligations are explained in the (liberal) licenese / terms for each item that you are using. These obligations typically relate to you agreeing to distribute any derivative code your project creates under similarly liberal licenses to those we use and to not undertaking unethical analyses (for example, those designed to re-identify research participants).

Secondly, modelling youth mental health systems is a big and complex task, so the more skilled hands applied to this task the better. Our field will benefit if more research teams apply open source approaches to their modelling and share their methods, data and tools with their peers.

There are a number of ways that teams who build youth mental health models can contribute to the ready4 project (and thus the wider youth mental health modelling field). These include:

* Using existing ready4 modules, datasets and analysis programs and giving us feedback and suggestions for improvement
* Sharing any work you undertake with ready4modules and analysis programs in open access repositories supported by ready4 (GitHub for development code, Zenodo for archived code and Dataverse for datasets)
* Redevelop your existing models with ready4 and share the results publicly
* Implement future modelling projects using ready4

If you are interested in these or other ideas, but are not sure what the practical implications are then contact us and we can arrange a chat.
