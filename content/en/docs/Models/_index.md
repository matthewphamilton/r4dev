  This section outlines how computational models of youth mental health systems are implemented under the ready4 framework.
---


Models are abstract and generalised representations of systems described in computer code. ready4 provides a framework for developing models that are modular. That means developing self-contained "modules" that independently model aspects of the people, places, platforms and programs relevant to young people's mental health and then combining them as needed for each project. The initial set of model modules that we have released are for modelling "people".
