  There are a number of priority project development areas for ready4 that we'd love your help with.
---


Our four priority areas are:

- Get all our code to production releases;
- Apply ready4 modules to new problems; 
- Develop and apply new ready4 modules; and
- Build a ready4 user community.



* Using existing ready4 modules, datasets and analysis programs and giving us feedback and suggestions for improvement
* Sharing any work you undertake with ready4 modules and analysis programs in open access repositories supported by ready4 (GitHub for development code, Zenodo for archived code and Dataverse for datasets)
* Redevelop your existing models with ready4 and share the results publicly
* Implement future modelling projects using ready4

If you are interested in these or other ideas, but are not sure what the practical implications are then contact us and we can arrange a chat.
