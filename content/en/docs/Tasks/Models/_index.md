Models are abstract and generalised representations of systems described in computer code. The base unit of a ready4 modelling project is a "Module". Modules describe a data structure and the algorithms that can be applied to it. Modules can be combined to model more extensive systems. Collections of modules of the same type are model "Sections". We are developing modules for the four system sections of people, places, platforms and programs. The initial set of model modules that we have released are for the "people" section.
