  The open source youth mental health systems model being developed with ready4 is called readyforwhatsnext.

The principal motivation for ready4 is to provide a framework for developing a *modular* computational model of the systems that shape the mental health of young people. 

A modular computational model is one that constructed from multiple self-contained components, called modules. Each ready4 module describes a data structure and the set of algorithms that can be applied to it. 

The computational model represented by the collection of all ready4 modules is called readyforwhastnext. Each ready4 module is also independently re-usable in other computational models. For example, selected subsets of ready4 modules represent computational models of the people, places, platforms and programs important to the mental health of young people.
