  The principal motivation for ready4 is to develop a modular computational model of the systems that shape the mental health of young people. 
---

A modular computational model is one that constructed from multiple self-contained components, called modules. Each ready4 module describes a data structure and the set of algorithms that can be applied to it. Each ready4 module is independently re-usable in other computational models. For example, selected subsets of ready4 modules represent computational models of the people, places, platforms and programs important to the mental health of young people.
