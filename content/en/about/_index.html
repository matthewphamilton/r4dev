<h1 class="text-center">ready4 was catalysed in July 2017 with funding from VicHealth, Orygen and Victoria University to develop an open source simulation model of resilience in young people. At that time, the project was called readyforwhatsnext.</h1>

We got [advice and feedback](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/advisory/) from young people, policy professionals, [modellers](/docs/getting-started/users/modeller/) and other researchers.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-map-marked" title="Conceptual Model" %}}
We developed a [conceptual model](/blog/2021/02/12/readyforwhatsnext-conference-posters-now-available/) to inform the development of the computational model.

We authored [development release software](/docs/getting-started/software/status/development-releases/) to support implementation of the ready4 [framework](/docs/framework/) and [model](/docs/model/).

<h1 class="text-center">The current phase of development of ready4 is focused on developing a Minimum Viable Product of the ready4 model and is being progressed by a PhD project at <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/organisations/sphpm-health-economics-group">Monash University's Health Economics Group</a> and multiple computational modelling projects at <a href = "https://www.orygen.org.au">Orygen</a>'s Health Services and Outcomes Research team.</h1>

The PhD candidature of ready4's project lead <a href = "https://mph-economist.netlify.app">Matthew Hamilton</a> is focused on developing ready4 as a valid and user-friendly tool to inform policymaking and system design relating to primary mental health services for young people in Australia. In addition to peer-reviewed publications, targeted outputs from this PhD program of research include <a href = "/docs/getting-started/software/status/production-releases/">production releases</a> of ready4 <a href = "/docs/getting-started/software/libraries/types/framework/">framework libraries</a></a> and <a href = "/docs/getting-started/software/libraries/types/framework/">module libraries</a>, open access <a href="/docs/datasets/">datasets</a>, <a href="/docs/analyses/replication-code/">reproducible analyses</a> and <a href="/docs/analyses/decision-aids/">decision aids</a>.

ready4 is being applied to a number of <a href = "/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/">computational modelling projects</a> at Orygen, that extend the scope of ready4 beyond what is being developed under the PhD program. Examples of current and recent projects include those in <a href = "/docs/analyses/replication-code/model-choice/">choice modelling</a> and <a href = "/docs/analyses/replication-code/map-utility/">utility mapping</a>. Details of project funders are available in the citation information, meta-data and acknowledgements of the modules, datasets, analyses and manuscripts associated with each project.

<h1 class="text-center">All ready4 code to date has been written by <a href = "https://mph-economist.netlify.app">Matthew Hamilton</a>, Glenn Weisner and Caroline Gao. Our planned next phase of development will therefore focus on building a <a href = "/community/">community</a> to sustain, extend and apply ready4 - and <a href = "/docs/contribution-guidelines/">we need your help to make this happen!</a></h1>
